# Out of Eggs

Out of Eggs was a web app for organizing grocery lists using inline editing and drag-and-drop organizing. It was designed to get you through your stores quickly and used a multi-columned layout including a print-friendly format with checkboxes.

I started development on it in 2009 and maintained it through 2010. A mobile web app was also started ([code](https://github.com/pderksen/outofeggs/tree/master/code/MobileAppShell)) but didn't get very far. I built the application using Visual Studio 2010, ASP.NET MVC 2, jQuery, jQuery UI and SQL Server 2008.

It was also entered into a local startup contest, [59 Days of Code](https://59daysofcode.org/), in their inaugural year.

It was hosted and publicly used on outofeggs.com until taken down in 2017.
